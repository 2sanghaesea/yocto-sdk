Yocto with LSDK Components
==========================
Yocto with LSDK components provides recipes for the last Yocto release to use the latest and greatest components from LSDK as they get released. This eventually makes its way into the next community Yocto release at yoctoproject.org. 

Supported boards
================
lx2160ardb

Prepare build environment
=========================
To make sure the build host is prepared for Yocto running and build, please follow this [guide](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/3.0/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html) to prepare the build environment. 

Install 'repo' tool
===================
To use this manifest repo, the 'repo' tool must be isntalled first
```
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo  > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
```

Download Yocto Layers
=====================
The following is the step of how to use repo utility to download all Yocto layers according to the repo manifest.

```
$: mkdir yocto-sdk
$: cd yocto-sdk
$: repo init -u https://source.codeaurora.org/external/qoriq/qoriq-components/yocto-sdk -b Key_Account_C_Support
$: repo sync --force-sync
```

Building images
===============
Take lx2160ardb as an example:
```
$: . ./setup-env -m lx2160ardb
$: bitbake fsl-image-networking
```
or:
```
$: bitbake fsl-image-networking-full
```
Images will be found under tmp/deploy/images/ls2088ardb/.
